# cute-alt-f3
it's like ALT-F4 but made by a dumb femboy (me)

how to use?

- press CTRL + ALT + F3

how to add to startup?

- windows + R
- shell:startup
- create shortcut of skirt-alt-f4.exe
- paste it in the startup folder

Done.

P.S. DON'T PRESS CTRL+ALT+F3 ON YOUR DESKTOP (IT WORKS I TESTED IT)
